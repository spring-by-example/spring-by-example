This is an example showing how to use Spring MVC's annotation-based configuration for a 
CRUD form using Hibernate.

This project can be built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org).  It can also be imported into 
the Eclipse IDE, but the M2Eclipse plugin should be installed since it is used to resolve 
the classpath.  The project is also setup to use the Spring IDE (http://springide.org).
	
It can also be run from the command line with 'mvn jetty:run' and accessed at the url 
'http://localhost:8080/simple-form'.
