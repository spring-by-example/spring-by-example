This is a simple example showing how to use Tiles (http://tiles.apache.org) with Spring MVC.

This project can be built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org).  It can also be imported into 
the Eclipse IDE, but the M2Eclipse plugin should be installed since it is used to resolve 
the classpath.

It can also be run from the command line with 'mvn jetty:run' and accessed at the url 
'http://localhost:8080/simple-tiles'.
