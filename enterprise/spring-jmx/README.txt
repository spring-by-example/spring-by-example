Spring JMX is used to expose a bean with attributes and an operation.  JMX is also exposed 
over RMI and a client connects to the MBeanInfo and with a proxy of the bean.

This project can be built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org).  It can also be imported into 
the Eclipse IDE, but the M2Eclipse plugin should be installed since it is used to resolve 
the classpath.
