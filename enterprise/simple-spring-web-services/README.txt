Simple Spring Web Services example using JAXB for marshalling/unmarshalling.

This project can be built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org).  It can also be imported into 
the Eclipse IDE, but the M2Eclipse plugin should be installed since it is used to resolve 
the classpath.	

It can also be run from the command line with 'mvn jetty:run' ('http://localhost:8080/ws') 
and then the client test can be run.
