The Spring by Example Web module has classes to help integrate GWT with Spring 
for standard use, Spring Bayeux integration for Comet on Jetty, and some utiliies 
for processing images.

This project can be built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org).  It can also be imported into 
the Eclipse IDE, but the M2Eclipse plugin should be installed since it is used to resolve 
the classpath.
