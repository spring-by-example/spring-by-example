Spring by Example Utils

Note: The Maven JAXB plugin was used to generate the JAXB mappings used for testing, but 
so they wouldn't be included in the dist that part of the build was commented out and the 
generated classes were copied to src/test.

This project can be built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org).  It can also be imported into 
the Eclipse IDE, but the M2Eclipse plugin should be installed since it is used to resolve 
the classpath.
