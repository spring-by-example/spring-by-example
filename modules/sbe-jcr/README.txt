This is a simple example using some classes to help process nodes using JcrTemplate from 
Spring Modules underneath.

This project can be built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org).  It can also be imported into 
the Eclipse IDE, but the M2Eclipse plugin should be installed since it is used to resolve 
the classpath.
