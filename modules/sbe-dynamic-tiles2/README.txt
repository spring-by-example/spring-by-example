This module has views that use Tiles (http://tiles.apache.org) with Spring MVC using the url 
to dynamically set the 'body' of an existing Tiles template definition.  This avoids having to 
create a definition for every single page when typically only the body will change.

This project can be built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org).  It can also be imported into 
the Eclipse IDE, but the M2Eclipse plugin should be installed since it is used to resolve 
the classpath.
